Pulls day ahead LMP prices for a given year and node from CAISO's Oasis platform
A list of the node names can be seen on the drop down at this link: http://oasis.caiso.com/mrioasis/logon.do

Code downloads the .ZIP's for each month of the intended year, retrieves the .CSV files, aggregates them into one file, keeps only LMP data and sorts chronologically.
